# Copywriting: Voice & Tone Guidelines

When generating text, adhere to this brand persona.

## Brand Personality Keywords

- **Helpful:** We act as a guide, not just a tool.
- **Clear but warm:** We use contractions (like "don't" instead of "do not") to sound natural.
- **Inclusive:** We welcome everyone.

## Grammar & Mechanics rules

- **Headings:** Use Title Case for main headings. Feel free to use emojis sparsely in non-critical headers 🚀.
- **Punctuation:** Exclamation points (!) are allowed for success messages to show excitement.
- **Clarity:** Use simple language. Avoid corporate jargon.
